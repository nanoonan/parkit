# Overview
The *parkit* package provides some basic Python classes that support multiprocessing programming. Dictionaries, queues, logs (append-only lists), custom objects, and daemon processes are supported. All classes in *parkit* support transactional, concurrent access from multiple processes. Data is stored in LMDB which offers good performance.

# Installation
